This folder contains all the data used to generate Figures 2 and 3.


# Figure 2a:
* hist-l*-l*.dat - Normalised frequency distributions of dU/dl values (at lambda 0.2) for the two MCL1 ligands
* hist-boot-l*-l*.dat - Normalised frequency distributions of the means of bootstrapped resamples of dU/dl values (lambda 0.2) for the two MCL1 ligands

# Figure 2b:
* hist-ddG-l*-l*.dat - Normalised frequency distributions of ddG values for the same two MCL1 ligands

# Figure 3:
* skew-kurtosis-ties.dat - Skewness and Kurtosis coefficients for all 51 ligand pairs included in Figure 3. Column I --> Skewness coeff.; Column II --> Excess kurtosis coeff.; Column III --> Protein system; Column IV --> Ligand pair.
